            <p class="info">Mak's Pastries was created in 2024 by Makenna Metrick.​ Makenna fell in love with pastries after making her first set of chocolate chip cookies.
                  Makenna is a sixteen-year-old who loves to paint as well.
                 Mak's pastries came about after discovering that a pastry shop WAS possible.
                  Thanks to determination, this restaurant is now open!​</p>
